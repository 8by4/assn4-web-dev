            This blog is where I like to share my local food reccomendations. I am student at the
            University of North Carolina at Greensboro. It is my second year and I had recently found
            that people have been enjoying my reccomendations so I thought to make them public!

            Don is a Japanese restaurant with simple seating on Tate Street. It is open 11am-10pm on most days
            of the week.
          </p>
          <p class="blog_text">
            Don specializes in Teriyaki, Donburi, and Ramen. Having been there I must say my favorite thing on the menu
            is actually their curry! Japanese curry is far different to Indian curry as it is significantly less hot,
            instead airing on the side of sweetness. The curry has been my favorite but it is closely followed up by
            the Shoyu Ramen and the Don Katsu Don.

            Yum Yum's specializes in Hot Dogs and Ice Cream. My favorite thing to get there is their hotdogs. In my
            experience, I have not had a better one. They taste so much better than anything else I have had. The ice
            cream
            is so creamy and delicious and extremely well made. Along with this they also serve classic soda like
            cheerwine!

            Jake's Pub is a billiards pub that has many bar staples. It is located on Spring Garden Street and is open
            from
            11am-12am.
          </p>
          <p class="blog_text">
            Jake's has many options that are all very great but I believe their chicken stands out. My three
            reccomendations for
            this place is their buffalo chicken sandwich, the cheeseburger, and the cheesesteak. The chicken is so far
            the best
            I've ever had and stands out so much compared to other places. The cheeseburger and cheesesteak are also
            great but to
            me, the chicken is a homerun!
